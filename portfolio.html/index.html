  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’ve always been drawn to thinking outside the box—whether it’s coding, collaborating, or both at the same time. My technology journey started early, with a middle school coding class that paved a way for me to find a career I was interested in and a love of problem-solving that’s never burned out. I’m an enthusiastic, optimistic teammate who brings both energy and thoughtfulness to the table.
With a strong academic background and a passion for learning, I take pride in being someone people can count on—reliable, adaptable, and always ready to dive into a new challenge. </p>

<p>Whether I’m debugging a tricky function or brainstorming ideas with a team, I aim to make the process as fun as it is productive.
I intend to create a cybersecurity business to employ more people of color interested in technology. I was the Vice President of National Honor Society. I am going to Missouri State University for computer science. I love learning new things and meeting new people to make a better future.</p>
